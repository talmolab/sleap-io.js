 * Ultralytics YOLO format I/O (detection + segmentation + pose).
 *
 * This is a TypeScript port of `sleap_io/io/ultralytics.py` (Python sleap-io
 * v0.7.x, PR #395), adapted to the JS/Node data model and runtime.
 *
 * Ultralytics YOLO format specification:
 * - Directory structure: `dataset_root/<split>/images/` and
 *   `dataset_root/<split>/labels/`.
 * - Configuration: a `data.yaml` file defining dataset structure.
 * - Supported tasks (auto-detected per label line by value count):
 *   - **Pose**: `class_id x_center y_center width height x1 y1 v1 ... xn yn vn`
 *     (5 + 3k values) → {@link Instance}.
 *   - **Detection**: `class_id x_center y_center width height [confidence]`
 *     (5 or 6 values) → {@link UserBoundingBox} / {@link PredictedBoundingBox}.
 *   - **Segmentation**: `class_id x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn` (polygon) →
 *     {@link UserROI}.
 * - Coordinates: normalized to `[0, 1]`, origin at top-left.
 * - Visibility (pose only): `0` = not visible, `1` = visible but occluded,
 *   `2` = visible and not occluded.
 *
 * Node-only: datasets are directory trees of many files, so this module reads
 * and writes through the Node `fs`/`path` APIs (like `io/trackmate.ts`) and is
 * exported only from the Node entry point (`src/index.ts`), never the browser
 * bundle.
 *
 * ## Image I/O divergence from Python
 *
 * Python uses `imageio` to read image dimensions and to extract/encode video
 * frames. JS/Node has no equivalent always-available image codec, so:
 *
 * - **Reading**: image dimensions are obtained by parsing the image file header
 *   ({@link probeImageSize}, supporting PNG/JPEG/GIF/BMP/TIFF) rather than
 *   decoding the pixels. Falls back to the `imageSize` option when probing
 *   fails.
 * - **Writing**: when a frame is backed by an on-disk image file, the file is
 *   **copied verbatim** (preserving its encoding and extension); when a frame
 *   yields raw `ImageData`-shaped pixels (`{ data, width, height }`), it is
 *   encoded to PNG via `pako`; otherwise the frame is skipped with a warning
 *   (mirroring Python's "could not load frame → skip" behavior). The
 *   `imageFormat`/`imageQuality` options apply only to the raw-pixel PNG path.
